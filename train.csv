negative,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
negative,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
negative,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
negative,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
negative,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
neutral,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.

positive,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
negative,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
positive,@united But thanks for asking
negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
negative,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."

negative,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
negative,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
negative,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
negative,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
negative,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
negative,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"

negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
negative,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
negative,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
neutral,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
negative,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
negative,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."

negative,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!

positive,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.

negative,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
negative,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.

negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"

positive,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
negative,@united lol too little too Late Flight
negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability

negative,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."

negative,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
positive,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
negative,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
negative,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
negative,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail

negative,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
negative,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.

negative,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????

negative,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
negative,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated

negative,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"

negative,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
neutral,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
negative,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
negative,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/

negative,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
negative,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?

negative,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
negative,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.

negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
